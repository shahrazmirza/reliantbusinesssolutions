    "content": "Even if your tax affairs are relatively straightforward, it still pays to work with a professional accountant in order to make sure the process is done thoroughly and that you receive all the deductions to which you are entitled. It also helps to remove the stress, and ensures you don’t inadvertently receive any fines or penalties."

    "title": "Can I claim deductions on my personal tax return?",
    "content": "Any expenses that you incur as part of your job or employment can be claimed as a tax deduction. In this way, you reduce your liabilities and, if you have paid more tax than you were liable for, you may be entitled to receive a tax refund. Our tax accountants can advise you as to any specific deductions you are entitled to claim"

    "content": "A second look assessment is usually requested when there is disagreement over a tax assessment, or a refund is deemed to be insufficient. If you think you have not claimed all available deductions, or not received the size of refund you are entitled to, contact Clear Tax and our team will be happy to arrange a second look assessment. If we discover that errors have been made, we will lodge an amendment on your behalf to claim back any money you are owed."

It might be the right choice to set up as a company, trust, partnership, or operating as a sole trader might be more appropriate. Our specialist business accountants will work with you to create an entity and business structure that is right for your specific circumstances."
