    "content": "It is generally the case that any expenses you incur in the operation of your business can be claimed as tax deductions, e.g., costs associated with running a work vehicle, maintenance or repair of assets, etc. Some home office costs can also be deducted if you are required to work from home. However, itâs important to remember that any expenses you claim must be related to your work and business, not your personal or private use. You also need to maintain thorough records so as to be able to substantiate any claims."
